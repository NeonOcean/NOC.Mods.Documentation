<h1>Check For Preview Updates</h1>
<b>Default:</b> Disabled (False)

<hr />

<h2>About</h2>
<p>When this option is set to "enabled", preview updates will be accounted for when checking if a new version of Order is available. This setting will not allow for the mod to check for updates alone, the option "Check For Updates" must also be set to "enabled". Upon detecting that a new version is available for download, a simple notification will be displayed at the top right of the game, this notification can appear only once each game session. In order to check if any update is available, the mod will look for a file located at <a href = "https://dist.mods.neonoceancreations.com/mods/latest.json">dist.mods.neonoceancreations.com/mods/latest.json</a>, this file will be checked 15 seconds after a game session is first started, then once every 30 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If the mod Main by NeonOcean is installed, this setting will be ignored as Main will take over update checking and will use its own version of this setting.</p>
