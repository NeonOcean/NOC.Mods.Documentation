<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a setting that allows you to change whether you are notified of mod updates for each mod that uses Main and supports the feature. Upon detecting that a new version is available for download, typically, a simple notification will be displayed at the top right of the game, you should only ever get this once per game session for each mod.</p>

<h3>Updates From NeonOcean</h3>

<p>In order to check for updates from NeonOcean, the mod will look for a file located at <a href = "https://dist.mods.neonoceancreations.com/mods/latest.json">dist.mods.neonoceancreations.com/mods/latest.json</a>, this file will be checked 15 seconds after a game session is first started, then once every 30 minutes.</p>
