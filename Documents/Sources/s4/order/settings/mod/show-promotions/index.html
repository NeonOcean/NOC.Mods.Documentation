<h2>About</h2>
<p>When this option is enabled, Order will check for promotions about new mods, updates to existing mods or more from NeonOcean. Promotions about mods that are already installed on your game will usually never be displayed. Upon finding a promotion to show, a simple notification will be displayed at the top right of the game, this notification can appear only once each game session. In order to check for promotions, the mod will look for a file located at <a href = "https://dist.mods.neonoceancreations.com/promotions/promotions.json">dist.mods.neonoceancreations.com/promotions/promotions.json</a>, this file will be checked 20 seconds after a game session is first started, then once every 30 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If the mod Main by NeonOcean is installed, this setting will be ignored as Main will take over promotion checking and will use its own version of this setting.</p>
