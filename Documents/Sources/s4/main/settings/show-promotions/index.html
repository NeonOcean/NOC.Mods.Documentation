<h2>About</h2>
<p>When this option is enabled, Main can check for promotions about new mods, updates to existing mods or more from any creators using this mod. Promotions about mods that are already installed on your game will usually never be displayed. Upon finding a promotion to show, typically, a simple notification will be displayed at the top right of the game. Only one promotion from each mod creator should ever be shown in each game session.</p>

<h3>Promotions From NeonOcean</h3>
<p>In order to check for promotions from NeonOcean, the mod will look for a file located at <a href = "https://dist.mods.neonoceancreations.com/promotions/promotions.json">dist.mods.neonoceancreations.com/promotions/promotions.json</a>, this file will be checked 20 seconds after a game session is first started, then once every 30 minutes.</p>
