<h1>Order Overview</h1>

<p>Order is a relatively simple mod that works to allow for better control of the order in which a mods are loaded. Once this mod is loaded, it will read load order instructions specified by any other supporting mods. After Order does this, it must take the reins of from The Sims 4 to load mods in the way they request. Any mods unsupporting of Order should have their load orders remain unaffected by its presence.</p>
